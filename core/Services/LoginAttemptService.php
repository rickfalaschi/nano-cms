/**
 * Brute-force throttle for the login form.
 *
 * Two-dimension rate limit, both within a 15-minute rolling window:
 *   - Per email: 5 failed attempts → locked
 *   - Per IP:    20 failed attempts → locked
 *
 * Email and IP both being checked covers the two main attack shapes:
 *   - Many IPs against one account (credential stuffing) → email threshold
 *   - One IP against many accounts (spray) → IP threshold
 *
 * Why these numbers: 5 per email is tight enough to stop a serious
 * brute-force (5 tries/15min = 480/day, against a 1-in-millions search
 * space is nothing). 20 per IP is loose enough to allow shared-office
 * scenarios where multiple employees might mistype passwords on the
 * same network.
 *
 * Successful logins are recorded too (`succeeded=true`), so genuine
 * users who eventually got their password right stop counting against
 * the threshold — the lock query filters on `succeeded = FALSE`.
 *
 * Cleanup is NOT inline. Use `bin/nano cleanup:login-attempts` manually
 * (via SSH) or via cron. The throttle works correctly even if the table
 * is never cleaned because queries always filter by time window.
